# Introduction

This project tests https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/ as a training exercise in API. It comes from [NUNit and C# - Tutorial to automate your API Tests from scratch](https://dev.to/m4rri4nne/nunit-and-c-tutorial-to-automate-your-api-tests-from-scratch-24nf). The focus is on the Users section.

**This repo uses Java and Maven and Selenium instead of .Net 8, dotnet cli and Playwright for dotnet.**
